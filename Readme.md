For Code Execution

Code is written in using Python 2.7 and tensorflow 1.14

In phase 1 code, all addresses are relative addresses from the images hence no need for any change. Just simply run the Wrapper.py script. If you need to change the address, please change the address on line 114.  

In phase 2 code, all the default path are still there in the code. Use default arguments as given in the starter code. By default the Supervised Network model will run in testing phase. For training you can use the argument ModelType as given in the Problem Statement Other models have been commented out. There is nothing in the Wrapper.py as we weren't able to stitch the images from the Phase1 folder.
